# Definitions and Explanation

## 1. What is a Server

A server is an application that runs on the internet, or any other network for that matter. A server can be used to host websites, web applications.

## 2. Role of the Domain Name

A domain name is a human-readable address that represents the IP address of a server on the internet. It provides a convenient way for users to access websites without needing to remember IP addresses.

## 3. DNS Record for www

The DNS record for "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It's used to alias the "www" subdomain to the main domain, directing traffic to the same IP address as the main domain.

## 4. Role of the Web Server (Nginx)

The web server, in this case Nginx, acts as a reverse proxy and serves as an entry point for incoming HTTP requests. It can handle SSL termination, load balancing, and serving static content. It forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

## 5. Role of the Application Server

The application server runs the core logic of your website's application. It receives requests from the web server, processes them, interacts with the database if needed, generates dynamic content, and sends responses back to the web server for delivery to the user.

## 6. Role of the Database (MySQL)

The database stores and manages the structured data for your website. In this case, MySQL is used as the database management system. The application server communicates with the database to store and retrieve information required by the application.

## 7. Server Communication with User's Computer

The communication between the server (8.8.8.8) and the user's computer occurs over the internet using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested content.


# Issues with the Proposed Infrastructure

## 1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

The infrastructure has a single server that hosts all components. If this server fails or experiences issues, the entire website goes down. To address this, you could consider distributing components across multiple servers or using cloud services to ensure redundancy.

## 2. Downtime During Maintenance

When maintenance is required, such as deploying new code that necessitates restarting the web server, the website may experience downtime. This can lead to a poor user experience. Solutions involve implementing a staging environment, load balancers, or maintenance schedules to minimize impact.

## 3. Limited Scalability

With a single server, the infrastructure can't handle significant increases in incoming traffic. As the traffic grows, performance might degrade, potentially leading to crashes. To address this, you could introduce load balancers, scale resources vertically (adding more power to the server), or scale horizontally (adding more servers).
