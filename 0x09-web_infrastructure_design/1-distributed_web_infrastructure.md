# Web Infrastructure Design:

## 1. User Accessing the Website:

A user types "www.foobar.com" in their web browser.

## 2. DNS Resolution:

The DNS resolves "www.foobar.com" to the IP addresses of the load balancer.

## 3. Load Balancer (HAproxy):

Servers: Server1 (8.8.8.8), Server2 (8.8.8.9)
HAproxy is introduced to distribute incoming traffic between two servers for better load distribution and redundancy. It's configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm, sending requests alternately to Server1 and Server2.

## 4. Nginx Web Server:

Servers: Server1 (8.8.8.8), Server2 (8.8.8.9)
Nginx is installed on both Server1 and Server2 to handle incoming requests. It serves as a reverse proxy, manages SSL termination, and can also serve static content. It forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

## 5. Application Server:

Servers: Server1 (8.8.8.8), Server2 (8.8.8.9)
An application server hosts your website's application files (code base). It processes requests from Nginx, interacts with the database, generates dynamic content, and sends responses back.

## 6. Database - MySQL:

Servers: Primary/Master (8.8.8.10), Replica/Slave (8.8.8.11)
A MySQL database cluster is set up with a Primary (Master) and a Replica (Slave). The Primary handles write operations, and changes are replicated to the Replica. The application server communicates with the Primary for write operations and can read from either the Primary or the Replica.

## 7. Application Logic:

The application server executes the logic of your website, which involves handling user requests, querying the database, and generating dynamic content.

## 8. Response Generation:

The application server sends the generated content back to the Nginx server.

## 9. Nginx for Static Content:

Nginx serves static content directly, improving performance by offloading the application server.

## 10. Nginx Response:

Nginx receives content from the application server and returns it in the form of an HTTP response to the user's browser.

## 11. User's Browser:

The user's browser renders the received content and displays the website.


# Issues with the Updated Infrastructure

## 1. Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):

While we've introduced redundancy for some components, there are still potential SPOFs. The load balancer and the database cluster could be SPOFs. A failure in the load balancer or the primary database node could impact the entire system.

## 2. Security Issues:

The infrastructure lacks important security measures. There's no mention of firewalls, and HTTPS is missing. Firewalls are necessary to control network traffic, and HTTPS is crucial for encrypting data between the server and the user's browser.

## 3. Lack of Monitoring:

There's no monitoring system mentioned to track the health and performance of servers, applications, and databases. Monitoring is essential for identifying issues, ensuring uptime, and optimizing the infrastructure.
