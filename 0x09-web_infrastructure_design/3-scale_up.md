# Web Infrastructure Design:

## 1. User Accessing the Website:

A user types "www.foobar.com" in their web browser.

## 2. DNS Resolution:

The DNS resolves "www.foobar.com" to the IP addresses of the load balancer cluster.

## 3. Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy):

Servers: LB1 (8.8.8.8), LB2 (8.8.8.9)
HAproxy is configured as a cluster for redundancy and high availability in load balancing.

## 4. Web Servers:

Servers: Web Server1 (8.8.8.10), Web Server2 (8.8.8.11)
Dedicated web servers handle incoming requests, SSL termination, and static content.

## 5. Application Servers:

Servers: App Server1 (8.8.8.12), App Server2 (8.8.8.13)
Dedicated application servers process requests, interact with the database, and generate dynamic content.

## 6. Database - MySQL:

Servers: DB Server1 (8.8.8.14) - Primary, DB Server2 (8.8.8.15) - Replica
MySQL primary-replica cluster ensures data availability and redundancy.


# Explanation of Additional Elements:

## Load Balancer Cluster:

Adds redundancy for load balancing, ensuring uninterrupted service if one load balancer fails.

## Dedicated Web Servers:

Enhances performance by isolating web-serving tasks from application logic.

## Dedicated Application Servers:

Separates application logic, making scaling and maintenance more manageable.


## Issues with the Simplified Infrastructure:

## Complexity and Resource Usage:

Increased components can lead to complexity and resource consumption. Proper management is necessary.

## Data Replication Complexity:

Managing data replication between primary and replica databases might require careful configuration.

## Network Communication Overhead:

Having components on multiple servers could increase network communication overhead.

## Balancing Complexity and Benefits:

The architecture offers redundancy and scalability but requires careful planning and management.
