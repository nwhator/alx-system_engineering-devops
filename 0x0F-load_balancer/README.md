# 0x0F. Load Balancer Project

## Concepts
- Load Balancer
- Web Stack Debugging

## Background Context
In this project, we aim to enhance our web stack by introducing redundancy to our web servers. This not only allows us to handle increased traffic by doubling the number of web servers but also makes our infrastructure more reliable. In the event of one web server failure, the second one can seamlessly handle requests.

You have been given 2 additional servers:
- `gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-100.25.0.XXX`
- `gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-52.206.217.XXX`

To achieve this, Bash scripts will be used to automate the configuration of a brand new Ubuntu server based on the task requirements.
